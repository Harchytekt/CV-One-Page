# CV One Page

This repo contains six versions of my _CV One Page_ project.  
During my second year at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut, we had to design a one page resume for the _Front-end development_ course.

The six versions are:
- the [Draft version](2015-2016);
- the [Project version](2016-2017/1_Project);
- the [Holidays version](2016-2017/2_Holidays);
- the [New Year version](2017-2018/1_New%20Year);
- the [Summer version](2017-2018/2_Summer);
- the [Grey version](2019) _(work in progress)_.

The first three follow the rules for the [project version](2016-2017/1_Project) :
- be responsive;
- be accessible in IE8+, Chrome and Firefox;
- be written with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript _(jQuery and other libraries)_;
- be validated by the **W3C validator**;
- contain at least **one css transition**;
- contain at least **three jQuery animations/plugins**.


**Notes :**
2. the first three sites could contain some error in the [W3C HTML Validator][1] and [W3C CSS Validator][2] due to the myriad of favicons.
