# CV One Page

This repo contains several version of my _CV One Page_ project.  
During my second year at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut, we had to design a one page resume for the _Front-end development_ course.  

The website had to :
- be responsive;
- be accessible in IE8+, Chrome and Firefox;
- be written with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript _(jQuery and other libraries)_;
- be validated by the **W3C validator**;
- contain at least **one css transition**;
- contain at least **three jQuery animations/plugins**.

**Notes :**
1. the sites are compatible with Safari and make use of the CSS _backdrop-filter_ which is only compatible with this one;
2. the present sites could contain some error in the [W3C HTML Validator][1] and [W3C CSS Validator][2] due to the myriad of favicons.
